<h1>Students Database Management</h1>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>This is Students' Database Management system developed By Syed Shehroz Ali, if you want to know more about me you can <a href="https://github.com/ShahrozAliPK">click here</a>
    to visit my Github profile.This is a terminal version of this program that comes along with User login system (<a href="https://github.com/ShahrozAliPK/user-login">link</a>) means that
    this program runs on terminal i.e (no GUI) by executing the main code which is <i>execute.py</i> (can be found in the repo).You have to download
    the complete <i>master.zip</i> package from the master branch on your desktop/PC so that you can be able to use this free software on your
    computer too.I hope that you will find this software very <i>User-friendly</i>.Reviews and Comments are most welcome.Thank you!</p>

<h3>A Quick Overview</h3>
<p>This is a database management software especially designed for <i>Students' database.</i>It means that if you are a school teacher/head/receptionist
    etc. you will most probably find this software very helpful as you just have to fill the required entries for a <i>NEW ENTRY</i> every time
    for a new student.Moreover its very slow and annoying to perform a <i>linear search</i> across all the entries and find a particular entry
    for a student (especially when it comes to thousands of entries and beyond).Likewise, Updating/Deleting/Searching has been made so much easy
    to query a particular entry from the database.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
<h4>My Approach</h4>
<p>It's my theory or principle that whenever I start working on a new software/algorithm or try to solve a real world problem through <i>Computer
    Science</i>, the number challenge which I face is <b>Information Security</b> that means protecting the User stored data inside Computer
    and turn it into an uncrackable piece that is almost anti-hacked from all the malicious and spy attacks (as much as I can).Similarly the reason
    for protecting this software with a <i>Login System</i>is same as making it (almost) anti-hacked.</p>
    </li>

   <li>
<h4>User Login System</h4>
<p>Just like to access your Instagram/Facebook feed you first need to bypass the login access to reach your profile homepage.But if you enter
    incorrect information then you failed to get login access to your feed.In the same way, this software is also packed with login System.It means
    that at first you need to bypass it (if the computer allows you) and then you can get access to the main software so that no one can mess up
      with your database entries.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
    </li>

   <li>
<h3>Searching</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
<h4>Efficiently</h4>
<p>Seaching efficiently is also one of the most important task which I love to spend more and more time on it.Similarly Searching
  linearly can be acceptable when it comes to only hundreds of entries.But when you work in a busy environment where you don't like to spend
    much time for each query case then it is obviously seems to be impossible to go one be one across each student's entry and find your
    desired one.But what if? you only need to type certain info for a student and result bumps up on your screen?</p>
    </li>

   <li>
<h4>Effectively</h4>
<p>Now, that's annoying to keep entering certain infos for a student and then get the result but chances are if you mistype something
    then surely computer won't find that entry in the database.Therefore to come over this problem, my software is packed with a feature
    called <i>Open Entries by</i> <b>Class, Age, Alphabet</b> or <i>Open All entries</i> so that chances are less that you won't find a
    particular student.</p>

</ul>
    </li>

    <h3>Sorting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Uniqueness</h4>
          <p>Now here comes a big deal, what if there are 10 students whose <i>middle name</i> is <b>Hello</b>? You might think that we
            should jump to last or first name.Ok, but what if first, middle and last all are same for each of the 10 students than how
            could you differeniate each of them? Well here comes <i>Automatic ID Generation</i></p>
        </li>

   <li>
    <h4>Quering</h4>
          <p>Let's suppose you want to qurey <i>Hello World 50</i> of class 5 but what if there are more than one <i>Hello World 50</i>
            students in class 5, so how could you select your desired one <i>(obviously through physical detection and apperance)</i> but
            for computer all are same.So, that's why my program offers you <i>Automatic ID Generation</i> for each student which is the
            primary key to differeniate one <i>Hello World 50</i> student with other.</p>
